### Steps in Progress

1 [x] - Completed a first major section in client side (04-29-2021)
2 [ ]- Need to create a Node Server with MongoDB - Firebase is used only for authentication (to log the user and get token), not for databse.
3 [ ] - Once implemented Firebase on the back-end - when user register or login in the App - I will create a logic for update user in MongoDB. So, when user is logged in, the response will come from the specific back-end.
